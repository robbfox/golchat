25/05/2016, 12:11 - Sahida Parvin: I want to put in our what's app group
25/05/2016, 12:11 - Sahida Parvin: Agree with Charlott too much time they spend chatting or hiding behind the vans where they could pick the missing totes by themselves also scanning off process drivers side TL responsibility,shopper side TL needs to b on the shop floor from  4 am to 9 am or until shopping completely finished Yesterday Tony came to me to pick a Totes where there was only one item Sainsbury toilet tissue that highlighted that they don't want to pick Even one item or look for the missing totes,looking for missing totes and re-picking totes are GA tasks,
Rather than creates new rules everyday. 
Only reason we are having late vans we are not prioritising.now a days when u go to the driver side to help the vans out on time you get told oh that's not your side you go and carry on shopper side and by the time you come back u heard 3/4 late vans ,
